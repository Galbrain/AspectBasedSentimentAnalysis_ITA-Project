# Project State

## Planning State 

We were making progress for the first milestone, which includes collecting the dataset. For that we implemented a webscraper for user reviews for different games on spieletipps.de that collects the reviews together with the users ratings according to the four aspects: graphics, sound, controls and atmosphere. The rating ranges from 0 to 5, where zero is the worst and 5 the best.
We stored the raw data in a json file, one for each game, where we have the title of the game and the reviews as keys. The reviews are stored in a list which again contains a dictionary with the actual text and the star rating of the review. However, implementing the webscraper was very challenging due to popups on the page. Even though we found a way to handle most of them, it might still be the case that webscraper will be unable to close the popup and hence unable to collect the data from that page. To solve this, one can just run the webscraper for that page again and usually it will be able to close the popup in a second or third run. Of course this solution is not very elegant, but solving that problem automatically via code has a low priority, since we only need one valid run for each page to obtain our dataset and don't need the webscraper regularly.
Second part includes preprocessing of the raw data in a way that we obtain a dataset which can be used for the actual aspect based sentiment analysis. Aim was to obtain a dataset similar to the SentiHood (https://github.com/uclnlp/jack/blob/master/data/sentihood/sentihood-train.json). We achieved that by using regular expressions to detect the aspects and creating a dictionary entry for each of those sentences that contain at least one word that refers to one of the four aspects. This dictionary contains more information about the detected words and the aspect they relate to as well as the respective sentence, where the detected word is replaced with one of the tokens "GRAPHICS", "CONTROLS", "SOUND" and "ATMOSPHERE" depending on its aspect.


## Future Planning

First, we still need to apply some changes to the preprocessing part. For example, it might be the case that the webscraper is not able to extract the star rating, even if it actually exists (due to different tags for star ratings that we haven't seen before). That's why we might want to remove all ratings where he have zero stars for every aspect, even if the user really rated all aspects with zero stars. In this case it is less dangerous to remove some valid review instead of including some with wrong ratings.
Furthermore, as already mentioned the detection of the aspects is implemented via regex. More precisely, we are looking for the aspect itself, synonyms and words that include those. However, this step is not based on any statistical analysis of our dataset, we just used words that are usually common for that. So this step could be improved by some further analysis of our dataset.
Next, now that we created a dataset our next milestone is to implement the actual aspect based sentiment analysis. For that we first have to make a decision about the method we want to use (for example: https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/15/Papers/194.pdf which gives a lot of detailed information). No matter which paper exactly we want to use for this, there are some steps that are quite common for this task. This includes for example the representation of the words in a sentence via word2vec, the removal of words that do not appear in a sentiment lexicon (examples for german sentiment lexicons: https://github.com/sebastiansauer/pradadata/blob/master/data-raw/germanlex.csv or https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/german-sentiment-analysis-toolkit) and lemmatization to be able to compare the words in a sentence to the sentiment lexicon.


## High-level Architecture Description

For now, our preprocessing pipeline we want to implement look like the following. At first we need to do some basic processing in the form of normalization followed by stop word removal, as this will make our results more consistent. Since we settled on reviews in the german language, stemming doesn't look like a viable option anymore. This shouldn't be impossible, but since german is a more complex language than english in which the stem of a word can change in different time forms, we decided against it. Luckily, `spacy` supports lemmatization for german words, with which we can find the base form ("lemma") of a word.

Afterwards we need to find out which words people generally use to describe the four aspects we try to train for (graphics, sound, controls, atmosphere). This could be done by counting words in the dataset which different meassures (e.g. plain word count, tf-idf) or by looking up different lexica to find similar words.

After all this processing we should have a dataset containing reviews with labelled aspects and their potential sentiment (in form of user given rating). With enought samples we hopefully will account for inconsistencies created by the user himself, since it's totally possible that the user rates the grafics 5/5 start, but describes them as beeing bad and vise versa. This is something we will have to examine once we actually try to train with the data or if it's even a problem in general.


# Data Analysis

## Basic Statistics

Our intial dataset consists of 6894 reviews, which are stored in `.json` files as described earlier. The reviews are split among 42 games and we have a total of 10195 sentences containing at least one aspect.
At first we made some very basic analysis and started with a word cloud for all spoken words. For this we normalized the text and removed stop words.

![Word Cloud](pictures/word_cloud_graph.png)

The first thing that popped into sight is the word 'game'. This makes totally sense, since people are writing reviews about games in which the word would naturally be used. Therefore we also looked at the raw word count, to see how often it occurs.

![Word Count](pictures/most_common.png)

As you can see, the word 'game' leads the charts by quite a lot.That's why we would probably have to remove it, since for our project we don't get any value from it. Another good sign is the frequency of the words 'story', 'graphics', 'controls' and 'atmosphere', since those are the aspects we want to train for and people are appenrently writing about those quite a lot. From the word cloud we can also gather that people are also writing about their sentiment towards some things, since we see the words 'great' and 'fun'. The only potential issue here beeing that the word cloud is not containing any words stating a negative sentiment, which could mean two things. One explanation could be the general sentiment towards the selected games or people are more inclined to write about games they like. Either way, we propably have to diverify our dataset more and explicitly include games which are rated poorly.
There also is a prominent outlier in the word 'for'. This is probably the fault of the stop-word-remover not detecting the word, since it contains an 'รถ' in german and we don't process or encode is properly, which is why it propably doesn't get detected.

## Data Sample
Raw data sample:
```json
{"text": "Von Hamstergaming  (2):  Neben Assassin's Creed Black Flag und Assassin's Creed Rogue geh\u00f6rt dieser Teil zu einer der besten die Story ist ganz in Ordnung daf\u00fcr dass es um Rache geht und die Grafik ist auch sch\u00f6n anzusehen. \nEs geh\u00f6rt mit zu den besten weil man verschiedene Arten von Fortbewegungsm\u00f6glichkeiten hat wie z.B. in Venedig wo man sehr gut mit dem kleinen Boot vorankommt oder Monterigioni wo das Reiten sehr effektiv ist dazu liefert das Spiel noch Rennen mit den Fortbewegungsmitteln wie z.B. einem Kutschenrennen oder das klassische auf den D\u00e4chern h\u00fcpfen.Ist diese Meinung hilfreich?", 
"rating": {"Grafik": 4, "Sound": 3, "Steuerung": 4, "Atmosph\u00e4re": 5}}
